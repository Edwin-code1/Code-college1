    <h2 class="section-title">Figurate Numbers</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Figurate numbers are a class of numbers that can be represented as geometric shapes. Examples of figurate numbers include triangular numbers, square numbers, pentagonal numbers, and so on.</p>
      <p>Here are a few examples of figurate numbers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Triangular numbers: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...</li>
        <li>Square numbers: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...</li>
        <li>Pentagonal numbers: 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...</li>
        <li>Hexagonal Numbers: 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...</li>
        <li>Heptagonal Numbers: 1, 7, 18, 34, 55, 81, ...</li>

    <h2 class="section-title">Arithmetic Progressions</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. The constant difference is called the common difference.</p>
      <p>Here is an example of an arithmetic progression:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Starting number: 3</li>
        <li>Common difference: 2</li>
        <li>Arithmetic progression: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...</li>
      </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Geometric Progressions</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>A geometric progression is a sequence of numbers in which each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.</p>
      <p>Here is an example of a geometric progression:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Starting number: 2</li>
        <li>Common ratio: 3</li>
        <li>Geometric progression: 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, ...</li>

    <h2 class="section-title">Inductive Reasoning</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Inductive reasoning is a form of reasoning that involves making generalizations or predictions based on specific observations or patterns.<br> It is a logical process that moves from specific instances to a broader conclusion.<br>Unlike deductive reasoning, which is based on a set of premises and reaches a specific conclusion, inductive reasoning involves reasoning from the particular to the general.</p>
      <p><strong>General Premises</strong></p>
      <ul>
        
        <li>Observation: The process starts with making specific observations or gathering data about a particular phenomenon or event.<br> These observations can be obtained through direct experience, experiments, or surveys.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pattern recognition: After gathering the observations, patterns or trends may emerge. These patterns can be similarities, repetitions, or regularities in the data.<br> The ability to recognize patterns is crucial in inductive reasoning.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Forming a hypothesis: Based on the observed patterns, a hypothesis or a general principle is formulated.<br> The hypothesis is a tentative explanation or prediction that seeks to explain the observed patterns.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Testing the hypothesis: The next step involves testing the hypothesis by gathering additional data or conducting further experiments. The goal is to determine if the hypothesis holds true for the new data or situations.</li>
        <br>
        <p>Here is an example of an Inductive reasoning:</p>
        <br>
        <li>Observation 1: Every crow observed so far is black.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Observation 2: Another crow is observed, and it is also black.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Observation 3: Yet another crow is observed, and it is also black.</li>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Inductive Conclusion: All crows are black.</strong></p>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Deductive Reasoning</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Deductive reasoning is a logical process that involves deriving specific conclusions from general principles or premises. It is a top-down approach where the reasoning starts with general statements or premises, and then applies logical rules to reach specific conclusions that necessarily follow from those premises. Deductive reasoning is often used in mathematics, logic, and formal systems.</p>
      <p><strong>General Premises</strong></p>
      <ul>
        
        <li>Premises: Begin with one or more general statements or premises that are assumed to be true. These premises can be principles, rules, definitions, or previously established facts.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Applying logical rules: Apply logical rules or deductive methods, such as modus ponens, modus tollens, syllogism, or mathematical operations, to draw specific conclusions based on the given premises.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Deductive inference: By using logical rules, deduce or infer new statements or conclusions that follow necessarily from the given premises. The conclusions derived through deductive reasoning are considered to be certain, provided that the premises are true and the logical rules are applied correctly.</li>
        <li> Validity: Evaluate the validity of the deductive argument. A deductive argument is considered valid if the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.</li>
        <br>
        <p><strong>Here is an example of an Deductive reasoning:</strong></p>

        <li>Premise 1: All mammals are warm-blooded animals.</li>
        <li>Premise 2: Dogs are mammals.</li>
        <br>
        <p>Conclusion: Therefore, dogs are warm-blooded animals.</p>
